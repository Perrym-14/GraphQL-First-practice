3 different ways to implementing GraphSQL server
    - Annotation: Use C# Attributes
    - Code-first
    - Schema-first

  - In both annotation and code-first apporaches, we only write resolvers. The schema gets automatically generated. The C# type system and GraphQL make this possible
  - Just typing to look busy. Need to take a small little break

  Behind the scenes, Hot Chocolate converts get accessors to resolvers.
