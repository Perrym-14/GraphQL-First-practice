3 different ways to implementing GraphSQL server
    - Annotation: Use C# Attributes
    - Code-first
    - Schema-first

  - In both annotation and code-first apporaches, we only write resolvers. The schema gets automatically generated. The C# type system and GraphQL make this possible
  - Just typing to look busy. Need to take a small little break

  Behind the scenes, Hot Chocolate converts get accessors to resolvers.

  - Think about using href pattern to avoid large responses
    - The href will point to endpoint that contains more detailed info if needed.

- Resolver chains
    - 

Advantages over REST
    - Keeps n+1 events in the server, not the client.
    - Avoid making a call with a relatively large response, just to discard what you don't need. The effects can be costly, especially if the client app has slow netowrk speeds.
    - REST api would have to make multiple back and forth calls from client <=> server, when doing a sequence of operations to get all necessary data.
